\input{introduction}

\subsection{Requirements}

Outline the detailed requirements specified in the assignment text.

\begin{itemize}

\item First requirement
\item Next requirement
\item etc.

\end{itemize}


\section{Technical Background}

Which topics are covered in this assignment. Should be short and cover the
necessary topics without mentioning your specific implementation and design.

\subsection{Data Structures}

Since this is a course in algorithms, so it might be a good idea to cover the
basic data-structures(e.g. lists and trees). 

Figure shows how you can add figures to the report. And below is the LaTeX
syntax for adding a figure:

\section{Design}

How did you solve the assignment? Describe the architecture and any design
choices you've made. Show figures of the proposed architecture.

\section{Implementation}

How did you implement, deploy and run your application? No need to refer to
actual lines of code.

\section{Discussion}

Any advantages or disadvantages with your design?

\subsection{Evaluation}

This section should contain relevant graphs and test results.

\section{Conclusion}

Sum up by restating the problem and solution. Follow up with a brief summary of
the solution along with lessons learned. \cite{10.1145/2673577}
